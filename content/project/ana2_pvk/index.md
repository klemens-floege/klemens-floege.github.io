title: "Analysis II Exam Preparation Course: Multivariable Calculus"
summary: "This document outlines the Analysis II exam preparation course conducted by Klemens Flöge for Prof. Tristan Rivière's class in the Spring semester of 2021. The course, delivered in German, aimed to deepen students' understanding of multivariable calculus, covering topics such as topology, differential calculus in multiple dimensions, optimization, implicit functions and diffeomorphisms, multiple integrals, and major integral theorems like Green's, Gauss's, and Stokes's theorem. The script reflects an effort to bring theoretical concepts closer to students, fostering intuition in Analysis."
