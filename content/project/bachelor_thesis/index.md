summary: "This Bachelor Thesis presents a numerical analysis of zero-dimensional Fabry-Pérot micro-cavities, emphasizing the impact of integrating hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) freeforms to manipulate electric field distributions. Through the development and application of numerical models, the study explores the effects of various hBN lens shapes and configurations within Fabry-Pérot cavities, revealing significant insights into the dependence of transverse confinement on lens curvature and the behavior introduced by multiple lenses. This research contributes to the understanding of optical micro-cavities and lays the groundwork for further exploration of arbitrary hBN shapes in optical device engineering."

This thesis undertakes a detailed exploration into the manipulation of electric field distributions within Fabry-Pérot micro-cavities through the novel introduction of hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) lenses. Leveraging advanced simulation tools, the study systematically dissects the impact of hBN lens shapes on electric field behaviors, unveiling a spectrum of photon confinement phenomena and laying foundational insights for future optical cavity designs. The successful replication of existing models and subsequent original analysis mark a pivotal step towards harnessing the full potential of micro-cavities in optical research and applications.
