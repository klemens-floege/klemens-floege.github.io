title: "Master Thesis: Meta-Learning within the PAC-Bayesian Framework"
summary: "This master thesis delves into the exploration of Meta-Learning through a PAC-Bayesian lens, introducing the PACOH algorithm as a new class of meta-learners with probabilistic performance guarantees. It bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical foundations in Meta-Learning, offering a comprehensive analysis and numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches."

The thesis presents a novel perspective on Meta-Learning, emphasizing the role of PAC-Bayesian bounds in developing robust meta-learners. It introduces the PACOH algorithm, which not only showcases state-of-the-art performance but also underscores the importance of probabilistic guarantees in the learning process. Through a series of numerical experiments, the thesis evaluates the performance of PACOH, comparing it with traditional meta-learning algorithms and highlighting its superiority in various tasks. This work not only contributes to the theoretical advancements in Meta-Learning but also paves the way for future research in applying PAC-Bayesian principles to other domains.
