title: "GPU-based Real-time Data Processing for Ultrafast Laser Applications"
summary: "This project explores the development and implementation of a real-time data processing system using the Spectrum M4i.4420-x8 digitizer card and SCAPP framework to enhance data acquisition in ultrafast laser experiments. By leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the system processes large data volumes from high-resolution spectroscopy and rapid pump-probe measurements more efficiently than traditional methods. The study demonstrates significant improvements in flexibility and data processing speed, offering a new approach to handling the demanding data analysis requirements of cutting-edge laser research."
